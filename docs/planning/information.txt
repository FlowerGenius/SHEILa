SHEILa has a central memory storage, hosted on a linux server.

SHEILa maintains one personality, though any number of instances of this personality may be active simultaneously

An active SHEILa must include an active data bank, and one or more active SHEILa runtimes.

Any instance of the SHEILa runtime must have full access to this data bank.

Every instance of the SHEILa runtime must have full access to this data bank.

EMOTIONALITY:
  Sheila has three levels of emotionality.
  1. The GLOBAL MOOD  is the collective conditions of all running instances of the runtime 
  2. The INSTANCE MOOD  is the current condition of a single running instance of the runtime 
  3. THE MEMORY MOOD is the emotion data hardcoded into a memory binary
